# The idea 

The project is a simple Todo list app, to remind me the basics of TypeScript, html and css.
After this I will remind myself the Angular. When ts and angular small projects will be done, I will create one big personal project.

### Functionality
Tasks can be added, deleted, completed and displayed all.
All tasks can be displayed as well as done and undone tasks.

Understood, that in order to continue, I need to have more knowledge in TypeScript as well as in JavaScript.
Lack of experience stops my to bind events. Need to understand it before proceeding.
